# README

Guides, conventions, and templates intended to make FTW projects more consistent, especially related to documentation and development tasks.


Foremost, each project should have a `README.md` which clearly describes the project and how to run in.

If you are ever unable to get a project up and running to test or develop it, file an issue.
